{-
You should have Elm installed on your computer.
If you do, go ahead and try to compile this file with:

    elm-make Main.elm

If this was the first time you do this in this directory, Elm will install some
necessary packages and then give an error about this code.

Your job is to make this compile and say "Hello Elm" using the Html package
already imported for you.

The easiest way to serve the compiled app is to either use

    elm-reactor

or

    elm-live Main.elm
